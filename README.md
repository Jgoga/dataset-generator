# Pascal VOC style dataset generator for Machine Learning projects
It is a very simple program to generate Pascal VOC style learning dataset from images. It generates images and XML style annotations with bounding box coordinates.

I've created this tool because I was needed to generate a large set of data for my machine learning project. I wanted to train a YOLO model with game cards. In my case I had to create some learning playgrounds like this one:
